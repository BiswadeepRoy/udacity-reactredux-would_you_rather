This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Overview
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, we have build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”.

In our app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and also see the ranking of users on the leaderboard based on new questions created and polls answered.
